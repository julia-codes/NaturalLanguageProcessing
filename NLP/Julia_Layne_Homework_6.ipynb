    "For this text similarity project, I went to amazon to find 24 books for this homework. The 'Book' category was more of a dashboard for sets of featured books. Using the search feature with an empty string, but the book category selected just took me to the same dashboard view of featured books. So instead under the category of book I searched the simple string 'book'. This gave the 24 titles I required. I cleaned them by removing the commas in titles to make saving as a csv cleaner. This was imported as the `books` dataframe from `book.csv`."

    "Initially I stopped calculating the bottom half of the matrix because it was duplication of work, but that weighted the first books to be most dissimilar because they were first listed and contained all comparisons. Instead, I built the matrix out fully assigning 0 to those most dissimilar and 1 to the column that contains the book's own title. "
